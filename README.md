# Random-World-Generator
Pseudo-random world generation with lighting, 2D landscape, multiplayer features, and open source flexibility, made in Java. This code was written in response to a project assignment in the DSA class at Berkeley but is published here for recruiters and employers, not future students.

To run the game, run ./byow/Main.main() in intelliJ with all the jar files as libraries added to the project structure.
